# Challenge 02

## Description

This repo demostrates my ability to create a personal porfolio as well as showcase the coding projects I have completed and deployed. This portfolio also showcases its ability to respond to different screen sizes and devices. This includes the use of flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The purpose of creating this protfolio is to attract an employer's attention so they may asses whether I'm a good candidate for an open position.
